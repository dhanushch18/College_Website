        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <div class="campus">
            <p>St. Thomas College of Engineering & Technology is known for having a vibrant campus life. A studentâ€™s enrolment into the institution offers diverse opportunities to enhance their intellectual, emotional, physical, spiritual, and professional abilities. They are encouraged to enrich their educational and leadership skills through involvement in department associations at the college, not being content simply with pursuing a program of study. One such opportunity to grow is through participation in department associations and campus life activities. The understanding of technical concepts taught in the class is further strengthened when they are applied in fun activities and competitions. STM is committed to the philosophy of supporting the development of students and strives to achieve this goal through the implementation of a diverse array of campus activities, and events.</p>
